# Park Finder
Park Finder has been created as my first Capstone Project for Thinkful (https://thinkful.com/). It is built as a responsive web application that uses informations from third party API  https://OpenWeatherMap.com and https://maps.googleapis.com, to present the user with information pertinent to weather and parks around the location entered by the user.

## Summary
